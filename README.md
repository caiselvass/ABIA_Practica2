# AI Planning with PDDL: Python Execution Guide

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) in AI for planning and executing tasks. It showcases the development and execution of planning algorithms tailored for various test scenarios.

## Directory Structure and Requirements
The correct functioning of Python scripts relies on the integrity of the directory structure within `ABIA_Practica2_Roger_Cai_Pau`. Do not modify any directories or files in this directory to ensure the scripts run as expected.

### Execution Instructions

1. **generate_test_cases.py**: This script interacts with the user through terminal prompts to generate and execute test cases. Type "HELP" in response to any question for additional information. While this is primarily for Windows and MacOS, Linux users should perform execution manually.

2. **generate_plots_experiments.py**: Generates plots from experiment data located in `ABIA_Practica2_Roger_Cai_Pau/experiments/data`. No need to run this script if you only want to view plots, as they are pre-generated in `ABIA_Practica2_Roger_Cai_Pau/experiments/plots`.

### Recommendations

- Execute Python scripts from the `ABIA_Practica2_Roger_Cai_Pau` directory using Visual Studio Code for optimal compatibility, as the development was done under these conditions.
- If running scripts from a terminal, ensure `ABIA_Practica2_Roger_Cai_Pau` is set as the current directory.

## About AI Planning and PDDL
AI planning with PDDL involves defining actions, goals, and the environment to automate decision-making processes. This project applies these principles to efficiently plan and solve predefined scenarios, demonstrating the practical applications of AI planning in complex systems.
