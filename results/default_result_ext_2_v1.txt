no optimization required. skipping criterion.


no metric specified. plan length assumed.

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

Enforced Hill-climbing failed !
switching to Best-first Search now.
